# Cryptocurrencies

**Overview of Analysis**

This project involves creating an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. It involves creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market, and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.

The dataworked on is not ideal, so it was processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the client is looking for, unsupervised learning was used. A clustering algorithm was used to group the cryptocurrencies and data visualizations were usedto share findings with the board.

The following deliverables were created in the project:

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results


Below are snapshots of the results of analysis performed
